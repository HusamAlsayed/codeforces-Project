# codeforces-Project


this project is about dealing with codeforces based on their api , how ever there's certain feature which can not be found on their api , so we used some scrapping technique to scrap certain things .. 




## How this Work ? 


i test this code on colab only , because its hard to scrap data with slow internet connection 

## Prerequests 

you should download the selenium library 

on colab it works like that 


### !pip install selenium
### !apt-get update # to update ubuntu to correctly run apt install
### !apt install chromium-chromedriver
### !cp /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin

### import sys
### sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver')

and then copy those files into your colab 

and you are good to start .
